White cat sleeps on a black shirt. Scratch the furniture. Love to play with owner's hair tie hiss at vacuum cleaner, but stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring . Scratch the furniture make meme, make cute face. Please stop looking at your phone and pet me purr while eating.
